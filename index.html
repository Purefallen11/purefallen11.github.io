            <h2> About me </h2>
            <p> I love solving puzzles, tackling projects head-first and seeing it done till the end. 
                However, I have been lost on what to do for the past 6 months, bouncing between dead-end jobs, wondering if I should go back to school or just
                work any job that would pay good enough to help me survive. it wasn't until I discovered
                <em>coding</em> that I felt found. I decided to follow my instict and treat it like a puzzle, diving in, learning as much as I can and hoping 
                that at the end of this journey, this pays off. </p>

            <h2> I am currently working on...</h2> <!-- this section will change periodically-->
            <p>
                My goal is to learn to make fun and interactive websites and apps. I also want to learn how to work on servers; Connect, maintain and install them.
                So far, I love coding. it can get complicated at times because I am not always very creative. sometimes I can write down a huge paragraph and 
                understand how to code it into an html file, however, styling it is not always the easiest thing.
